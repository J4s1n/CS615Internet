I am an MSc Data Science student with a strong focus on Bayesian Data Analysis, Linear Models, and Statistical Inference. My studies involve R for Data Analytics, and I have worked on projects like spatial data analysis of sports centers in Cork and Dublin and an in-depth analysis of the Olympics Fencing dataset.

Beyond data science, I am expanding my technical expertise in web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and dynamic applications. My approach to problem-solving is data-driven, detail-oriented, and accuracy-focused, ensuring that every analysis and implementation is both precise and insightful.

Currently based in Maynooth, Ireland, I am continuously refining my skills in statistical modeling, data visualization, and software development, always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies
